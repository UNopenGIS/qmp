# Methods
Quick Mapping can have multiple methods, and anyone should be able to add their own methods. For now, we present a preliminary Method A.

## Method A
- Create maps using [Rapid Editor](https://rapideditor.org/)
  - Rapid Editor is a tool that uses AI-analyzed satellite imagery to create maps. It is also an example of implementing "We co-create with generative AI."
  - Add the tag "#qmp" to the changeset when registering the map on OpenStreetMap.
- Manage mini-projects using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/unopengis/qmp/issues)
  - GitHub Issues is a tool for managing project progress. It helps visualize mapping progress and share information among team members.
