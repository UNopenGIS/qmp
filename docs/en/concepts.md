# Concepts

## Quick Mapping
Quick Mapping (QM) is an activity aimed at creating maps quickly and making them immediately usable based on the needs of users.

The key feature of QM is leveraging the existing OpenStreetMap (OSM) ecosystem. OSM is a platform for map data that anyone can freely edit and use.

### Quick Mapping Project (QMP)
The Quick Mapping Project (QMP) serves as the community of practice for advancing Quick Mapping.

Through open activities and technical collaboration projects, QMP aims to operate sustainably.

### Quick Mapping Challenge (QMC)
To launch QMP, a time-limited activity called the Quick Mapping Challenge (QMC) is planned for the fiscal year 2025.

## We co-create with generative AI
In February 2024, Yuiseki stated, "In the near future, we need to be prepared to welcome sufficiently advanced AI as our companions." Inspired by this, QMC aims to co-create with AI at a high level. Specifically, the following practices will be implemented:

- Generative AI will be actively utilized in creating documentation, including this file.
- Generative AI will also be used extensively in map creation practices, such as with the Rapid Editor.

## It's easy to be brave enough to map
Mapping can be done by anyone who feels the need for maps, even if they are inexperienced. This section provides specific methods to demonstrate that a little courage is enough to start mapping.

Even experienced mappers can leverage their advanced skills to create new value, showing that courage can lead to innovation through specific community practices.

## Vertical Integration
Vertical integration refers to mutual communication and simultaneous project advancement between experienced and inexperienced participants.

Unlike the business term "vertical integration," this concept emphasizes collaboration across skill levels within a project team.

Participants with different levels of knowledge and experience share insights, learn from each other, and grow together.

## Strategic Use of Geospatial Information
This involves using geospatial information in a timely manner for daily administrative tasks, analysis, and decision-making.
