# Modular Structure and Project Approach

We co-create with generative AI. It's easy to be brave enough to map.

This project adopts a modular structure. A modular structure allows each participant to contribute independently, while ensuring that all contributions harmonize as a whole. This approach is based on the following principles:

## Principles of Do-ocracy

- Respect for autonomy: Instead of following instructions, each participant brings what they can offer.
- Action creates value: The project progresses through actual actions taken by participants.
- Shared responsibility: Each participant takes responsibility for their contributions.

## Benefits of a Modular Structure

1. Flexibility: New ideas and contributions can be easily added.
2. Independence: Each module functions independently, enabling efficient work.
3. Coordination: The structure ensures that the overall outcome is unified.

## Requests to Participants

- Contribute in your area of expertise.
- Respect and collaborate with the contributions of others.
- Coordinate with other modules as needed.
